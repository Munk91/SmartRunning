# SmartRunning - Project Initialization

## Project Overview
SmartRunning is a comprehensive running application with two main components:
1. Backend API (Node.js/Express) for user management and activity tracking
2. Frontend UI (Python/Streamlit) for route generation and data visualization

## Backend Setup Tasks (Node.js/Express)
1. Initialize a new Node.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up basic project structure
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier
4. Set up Jest for testing
5. Create basic README.md
6. Initialize Git repository with .gitignore

## Backend Implementation Details
- Framework: Express.js for backend
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
- Authentication: JWT

## Frontend Setup Tasks (Python/Streamlit)
1. Create Python project structure for Streamlit application
2. Set up requirements.txt
3. Create initial app.py with basic Streamlit UI
4. Implement routing.py for route generation logic
5. Configure map visualization

## Frontend Implementation Details
- UI Framework: Streamlit
- Routing Logic: OSMNX + NetworkX
- Map Visualization: Folium

## Route Generator Features
- Input:
  - Start location (address or coordinates)
  - Desired run distance (e.g. 5, 10 km)
  - Surface preference (e.g. asphalt, dirt, trail)
- Output:
  - A looped running route shown on an interactive map
  - Optionally downloadable as GPX

## Backend Features Roadmap
1. User authentication system
2. Running activity tracking
3. Activity statistics and analytics 
4. Goals setting and tracking
5. Social sharing features

## Integration Plan
- API endpoints for frontend to access backend services
- Authentication flow between Streamlit and Express
- Shared data models for activities and routes
