# Improve Streamlit UI in `app.py`

Please:

- Create user inputs for:
  - Location (text input)
  - Desired distance (slider, 1–20 km)
  - Surface type (dropdown: any, asphalt, gravel, dirt, trail)
- Add a “Generate Route” button
- Show loading spinner while generating
- Display the route as a Folium map
- Show error messages if route generation fails

Make it clean and responsive. Set page config with a wide layout.
